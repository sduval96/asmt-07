# Additional Hints:
# ---------------------------------------------
# You may need additional helper functions both in and out of the classes, add functions as you need to.
#
# No one function should be more then 50 lines of code, if you need more then 50 lines of code
# excluding comments, break the function into multiple functions.
#
# You can store your raw menu text, and other blocks of texts as raw text files 
# and use placeholder values with the format option.
# Example:
# In the file test.txt is "My name is {fname}, I'm {age}"
# Then you later can read the file into a string "filetxt"
# and substitute the placeholders 
# for example: filetxt.format(fname = "John", age = 36)
# This will make your code far more readable, by seperating text from code.
